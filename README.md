# Post-It-Up

This is my first small application where I am trying to explore some new technology with React.

## Overview

**Post-It-Up** is a simple note-taking application built using modern web development technologies. The main focus of this project is to learn and implement core React concepts and integrate it with Firebase for backend services.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Authorization, Hosting)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Language:** JavaScript

## Features

- **React Hooks:** Utilized for state management and side effects.
- **React Router:** Implemented for navigating between different pages of the application.
- **Props:** Used extensively for passing data between components.
- **Firebase Firestore:** Used as the database to store notes.
- **Firebase Authorization:** Implemented for user authentication.
- **Firebase Hosting:** Used to deploy the application.
- **Vite:** Used for bundling and as a build tool, offering fast development setup with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules for code quality.
